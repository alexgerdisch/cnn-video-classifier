# Pixel Matrix Generator and Classifier for use in Convolutional Neural Network training
## Streamlined workflow for generating training ready pixel matrices. 

Upload your video, edit your labels as needed, quickly add labels frame by frame.

Once you've classified as many video frames as you need, click download to get a JSON file of your training ready data.

To use it, run it as a local server, all work is done in the browser. Node verison coming soon for faster file processing times.

It is recommended to crop only your region of interest of your video to reduce noise and improve computational efficiency come training time.
